   - Reduce CO, NOx, and hydrocarbons by converting them into less harmful substances.

2. **Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF)**:
   - Trap and oxidize particulate matter in diesel exhaust.

3. **Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR)**:
   - Recirculates a portion of exhaust gases back into the engine to reduce NOx formation.

4. **Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR)**:
   - Uses a reagent like urea to reduce NOx emissions in diesel engines.

#### Compliance and Regulations

1. **Environmental Standards**:
   - Adhere to local and international regulations (e.g., EPA, Euro standards) for emissions.

2. **Testing and Certification**:
   - Conduct regular emissions testing and obtain necessary certifications for compliance.

By effectively measuring and controlling exhaust emissions, you can minimize environmental impact and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
