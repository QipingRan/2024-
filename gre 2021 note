GRE scoring can be a bit complex as it involves multiple sections and a composite score. Here’s an overview of how the GRE (Graduate Record Examination) is scored:

### Sections of the GRE:
1. **Verbal Reasoning**: This section tests your ability to analyze and evaluate written material and synthesize information obtained from it, analyze relationships among component parts of sentences, and recognize relationships among words and concepts.
2. **Quantitative Reasoning**: This section tests your basic mathematical skills and your understanding of elementary mathematical concepts, as well as your ability to reason quantitatively and solve problems in a quantitative setting.
3. **Analytical Writing**: This section measures critical thinking and analytical writing skills, specifically your ability to articulate and support complex ideas clearly and effectively.

### Scoring:
1. **Verbal Reasoning**:
   - Scores range from 130 to 170 in 1-point increments.
   - You will receive one score for the Verbal Reasoning section.

2. **Quantitative Reasoning**:
   - Scores range from 130 to 170 in 1-point increments.
   - You will receive one score for the Quantitative Reasoning section.

3. **Analytical Writing**:
   - Scores range from 0 to 6 in half-point increments.
   - You will receive one score for the Analytical Writing section.

### Composite Score:
- The composite GRE score is the sum of the Verbal and Quantitative Reasoning scores.
- The total score ranges from 260 to 340.

### Score Calculation:
- **Verbal and Quantitative Reasoning**: The scores are based on the number of correct responses. However, the GRE uses a section-level adaptive approach. This means your performance on the first section of Verbal or Quantitative Reasoning will determine the difficulty level of the second section you receive in that subject. The final score is then calculated based on the number of correct answers and the difficulty level of the questions.
- **Analytical Writing**: The essays are scored by a combination of a human rater and a computer program called e-rater®. If the scores from the human and the e-rater are closely aligned, the average of the two scores is used. If they differ significantly, a second human scores the essay, and the final score is the average of the two human scores.

### Example:
If you score:
- Verbal Reasoning: 155
- Quantitative Reasoning: 160
- Analytical Writing: 4.5

Your total GRE score would be 155 (Verbal) + 160 (Quantitative) = 315.

### Preparation Tips:
- Practice consistently using official GRE practice tests and materials.
- Focus on time management as the test is time-constrained.
- Develop a strong understanding of the basic concepts in math, as well as advanced concepts if you’re aiming for a high score in Quantitative Reasoning.
- Enhance your vocabulary and reading comprehension skills for the Verbal Reasoning section.
- Practice writing essays under timed conditions to improve your Analytical Writing score.

By understanding the scoring system and preparing effectively, you can aim to achieve a high score on the GRE.

The GRE (Graduate Record Examination) uses a section-level adaptive approach for its Verbal and Quantitative Reasoning sections. This means that your performance on the first section of each type determines the difficulty level of the second section you will receive.

### How Section Adaptation Works:

1. **Initial Section**:
   - When you begin the GRE, you will first encounter an initial section for both Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning.
   - The initial sections contain a mix of questions of varying difficulty levels.

2. **Adaptive Second Section**:
   - Based on your performance on the initial section, the GRE algorithm determines the difficulty level of the second section for both Verbal and Quantitative Reasoning.
   - If you perform well on the initial section, you will receive a more difficult second section.
   - If your performance on the initial section is average, you will receive a medium difficulty second section.
   - If your performance on the initial section is below average, you will receive an easier second section.

3. **Scoring**:
   - Your final score for each of the Verbal and Quantitative sections is determined by your performance across both sections.
   - Both the number of correct answers and the difficulty level of the questions you answered correctly are taken into account.
   - The GRE combines your performance from both sections to generate a scaled score that ranges from 130 to 170 for each section.

### Example:

- **Verbal Reasoning**:
  - Initial Section: You answer most questions correctly.
  - Second Section: You receive a more difficult section due to your strong performance.
  - Final Score: Your score reflects the difficulty of the second section and the number of correct answers across both sections.

- **Quantitative Reasoning**:
  - Initial Section: You answer a moderate number of questions correctly.
  - Second Section: You receive a medium difficulty section based on your average performance.
  - Final Score: Your score reflects the difficulty of the second section and the number of correct answers across both sections.

### Advantages of Section Adaptation:

- **Tailored Testing Experience**: The adaptive nature allows the test to be more responsive to your ability level, providing a more accurate assessment of your skills.
- **Efficiency in Scoring**: By adapting the difficulty level based on your performance, the GRE can better distinguish between test-takers of varying abilities.

### Preparation Tips:

1. **Practice with Official Materials**: Use official GRE practice tests to get familiar with the format and the types of questions you'll encounter.
2. **Focus on All Difficulty Levels**: Since the second section's difficulty depends on your performance, ensure you're comfortable with both easy and difficult questions.
3. **Manage Time Effectively**: Practice time management to ensure you can complete each section within the allotted time.
4. **Strengthen Core Skills**: Build a strong foundation in vocabulary, reading comprehension, and math concepts to handle questions of varying difficulty levels.

By understanding how the section-level adaptation works and preparing accordingly, you can optimize your performance on the GRE and achieve a higher score.
