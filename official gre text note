Score Reporting Three scores will be reported on the revised General Test: b a Verbal Reasoning score reported on a 130–170 score scale, in 1-point increments b a Quantitative Reasoning score reported on a 130–170 score scale, in 1-point increments b an Analytical Writing score reported on a 0–6 score scale, in half-point increments

Reading Comprehension Questions Reading Comprehension questions are designed to test a wide range of abilities required to read and understand the kinds of prose commonly encountered in graduate school. Those abilities include b understanding the meaning of individual words b understanding the meaning of individual sentences b understanding the meaning of paragraphs and larger bodies of text b distinguishing between minor and major points b summarizing a passage b drawing conclusions from the information provided b reasoning from incomplete data, inferring missing information b understanding the structure of a text, how the parts relate to one another b identifying the author’s perspective b identifying the author’s assumptions b analyzing a text and reaching conclusions about it b identifying strengths and weaknesses b developing and considering alternative explanations

Overview of the Quantitative Reasoning Measure The Quantitative Reasoning measure of the GRE revised General Test assesses your: b basic mathematical skills b understanding of elementary mathematical concepts b ability to reason quantitatively and to model and solve problems with quantitative methods Some of the questions in the measure are posed in real-life settings, while others are posed in purely mathematical settings. The skills, concepts, and abilities are tested in the four content areas below. Arithmetic topics include properties and types of integers, such as divisibility, factorization, prime numbers, remainders, and odd and even integers; arithmetic operations, exponents, and roots; and concepts such as estimation, percent, ratio, rate, absolute value, the number line, decimal representation, and sequences of numbers. Algebra topics include operations with exponents; factoring and simplifying algebraic expressions; relations, functions, equations, and inequalities; solving linear and quadratic equations and inequalities; solving simultaneous equations and inequalities; setting up equations to solve word problems; and coordinate geometry, including graphs of functions, equations, and inequalities, intercepts, and slopes of lines. Geometry topics include parallel and perpendicular lines, circles, triangles— including isosceles, equilateral, and 30°-60°-90° triangles—quadrilaterals, other polygons, congruent and similar figures, three-dimensional figures, area, perimeter, volume, the Pythagorean theorem, and angle measurement in degrees. The ability to construct proofs is not tested. Data analysis topics include basic descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, interquartile range, quartiles, and percentiles; interpretation of data in tables and graphs, such as line graphs, bar graphs, circle graphs, boxplots, scatterplots, and frequency distributions; elementary probability, such as probabilities of compound events and independent events; random variables and
