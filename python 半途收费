def decode(string): pass def encode(string): pass Instructions Implement run-length encoding and decoding. Run-length encoding (RLE) is a simple form of data compression, where runs (consecutive data elements) are replaced by just one data value and count. For example we can represent the original 53 characters with only 13. "WWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWBBBWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWB" -> "12WB12W3B24WB" RLE allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data, which makes it a lossless data compression. "AABCCCDEEEE" -> "2AB3CD4E" -> "AABCCCDEEEE" For simplicity, you can assume that the unencoded string will only contain the letters A through Z (either lower or upper case) and whitespace. This way data to be encoded will never contain any numbers and numbers inside data to be decoded always represent the count for the following character.

To implement run-length encoding (RLE) and decoding in Python, we will create two functions: encode and decode. Here's how we can approach each task:
Run-Length Encoding
1.Encoding:
1.Iterate through the input string.
2.Keep track of the current character and its count.
3.When the current character changes, append the count (if greater than 1) and the character to the result.
4.Continue this process until the end of the string.
Run-Length Decoding
1.Decoding:
1.Iterate through the encoded string.
2.If a digit is encountered, parse the number to get the count of the next character.
3.Append the character the number of times specified by the count.
4.If no digit precedes a character, assume the count is 1.
Implementation
Here is the Python code for both encoding and decoding functions:
python
复制代码
def encode(string):
    if not string:
        return ""
    
    encoded_string = []
    current_char = string[0]
    count = 1
    
    for char in string[1:]:
        if char == current_char:
            count += 1
        else:
            if count > 1:
                encoded_string.append(str(count))
            encoded_string.append(current_char)
            current_char = char
            count = 1
            
    if count > 1:
        encoded_string.append(str(count))
    encoded_string.append(current_char)
    
    return ''.join(encoded_string)
def decode(string):
    if not string:
        return ""
    
    decoded_string = []
    count = 0
    
    for char in string:
        if char.isdigit():
            count = count * 10 + int(char)
        else:
            if count == 0:
                decoded_string.append(char)
            else:
                decoded_string.append(char * count)
                count = 0
    
    return ''.join(decoded_string)
# Example usage:print(encode("WWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWBBBWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWB"))  # Output: "12WB12W3B24WB"print(decode("12WB12W3B24WB"))  # Output: "WWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWBBBWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWB"print(encode("AABCCCDEEEE"))  # Output: "2AB3CD4E"print(decode("2AB3CD4E"))  # Output: "AABCCCDEEEE"
Explanation
1.
Encoding:
2.
1.The encode function iterates through the input string and counts consecutive characters.
2.When a different character is encountered, it appends the count and the character to the result list.
3.If the count is 1, it only appends the character.
4.At the end of the string, it ensures the last group of characters is also added to the result.
3.
Decoding:
4.
1.The decode function iterates through the encoded string and constructs the original string.
2.It uses a count variable to handle multi-digit numbers.
3.When a non-digit character is encountered, it appends it the number of times specified by the count.
4.If no count is specified, it appends the character once.
These functions handle the run-length encoding and decoding efficiently and ensure the original data can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data.

Change Values Stored in Variables We can change the value stored in variables as per our needs. For example, age = 25 print(age) age = 26 print(age) Output 25 26 Here, The initial value of age is 25. So, the first print(age) prints 25. Its value is then changed to 26. So, the second print(age) prints 26.
ChatGPT
To demonstrate how values stored in variables can be changed in Python, you can use the following example:
python
复制代码
# Initial value of the variable age
age = 25print(age)
# Change the value of the variable age
age = 26print(age)
When you run this program, it will output:
复制代码
25
26
Explanation:
1.
Initial Assignment:
2.
1.age = 25 assigns the value 25 to the variable age.
2.print(age) outputs the current value of age, which is 25.
3.
Changing the Value:
4.
1.age = 26 changes the value of age to 26.
2.print(age) outputs the new value of age, which is 26.
This example demonstrates that the value stored in a variable can be updated, and subsequent uses of the variable will reflect the new value. This is a fundamental concept in programming, allowing variables to store different values at different points in time.
